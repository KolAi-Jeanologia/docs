# KolAi 3D Designer

KolAi 3D Designer is software for making denim dry process templates for use with 3D programs like Clo3D, V-Stitcher, or Tuka3D. KolAi's A.I. automatically extracts dry process templates from images of target garments.

KolAi 3D Designer incorporates a neural network (the "A.I.") that has been trained on thousands of examples of dry process templates. Thus, if you give the A.I. a picture of a target garment, it will automatically turn this into a dry process template that can be exported and used with any 3D design program. 

KolAi 3D Designer is available as a [Photoshop Plugin](https://docs.kolaidenim.com/3d/ps-plugin/).
