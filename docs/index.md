         style="width:50%">

</figure>

These templates can then be used with:  

 - 3D Software &mdash; like VSticher, CLO3D or TUKA3D &mdash; to visualize the dry-process.  
 - Laser Machines &mdash; from Jeanologia, VAV, MacsaID, Tonello, SEI, IberLaser or any others &mdash; to etch the dry process onto blank garments.

## Why KolAi?

It can take hours of work and years of experience to make a quality dry process template. KolAi speeds up the process and makes it easier by incorporating a trained A.I. system. Given an image of a target garment, the A.I. transforms the image into a dry process template in seconds. A denim designer can then spend their time perfecting the design, making edits where necessary, and running tests with their laser machine or 3D program.
