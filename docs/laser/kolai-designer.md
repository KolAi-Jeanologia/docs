# KolAi Designer

KolAi Designer is a web-based photo-editor, designed specifically for making denim dry process templates for laser. The interface looks and works similarly to Adobe Photoshop (i.e., it has a layers panel and tools like the Brush, Clone Stamp, and Quick Select). 

The main advantage of using KolAi Designer over general photo-editing software like Photoshop is that it incorporates a neural network (the "A.I.") that has been trained on thousands of examples of dry process templates. Thus, if you give the A.I. a picture of a target garment, it can automatically turn this into a dry process template that can be exported and used with any brand of laser machine to etch the template onto a raw garment. 

KolAi Designer is the *only* A.I-based system for making laser files for denim. 

## How to Sign Up for KolAi Designer

You can sign up for a KolAi Designer account here: 

[KolAi Designer Sign Up](https://www.kolaidesigner.com/select-plan/){target="_blank", .md-button}

You can either purchase tokens that give uses of the A.I. (1 token = 1 use) or you sign up for a subscription plan that allows for unlimited usage of the A.I. In addition to the A.I. portion of the platform, there is also an Image Editor which is like having Photoshop in the browser. **The Image Editor is free to use indefinitely.** KolAi only charges a use when you send an image to the A.I. for processing. 

In addition to the plans listed at the page above, KolAi also offers custom plans to suite the needs of larger manufacturers. If you think you might need a custom plan or have questions about the existing plans, you can contact the KolAi team here:
